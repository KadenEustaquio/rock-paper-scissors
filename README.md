# rock-paper-scissors

This is a Rock, Paper, Scissors simulator. It's themed after Pok√©mon, and I focused mostly on stretching the limits of my Front-End Development, using just basic HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The game functions around a home page, which has support for multiple versions of the game - a singleplayer mode against a computer, and a two-player version. I have not made the two-player version yet, but the one-player version is fully functional, and has working graphics and event listeners!
